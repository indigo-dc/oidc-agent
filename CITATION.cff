abstract: >-
  The oidc-agent is an OpenID Connect tool suite designed to
  simplify authentication processes for command-line
  applications and workflows that require access to
  resources protected by OpenID Connect. It provides a
  secure, but user-friendly way to manage tokens on the
  command-line, reducing the need for manual
  re-authentication. This paper presents an in-depth
  overview of the architecture and features of the tool
  suite, alongside its real-world applications. oidc-agent
  serves as a valuable tool in token based authentication
  workflows, particularly for applications in cloud
  computing, high-performance computing, and scientific
  research, where efficient and secure access to resources
  is critical.
