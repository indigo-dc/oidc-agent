oidc-tokensh \- Ensure that valid Access Tokens are always available

oidc-tokensh starts a new shell within which oidc-agent is available. It
prompts for a password to unlock an account configuration, when necessary.

Access Tokens are automatically renewed for the specified account, before
they expire.
