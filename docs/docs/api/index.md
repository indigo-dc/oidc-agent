# API
If you want to use `oidc-agent` to easily obtain an access token in your
application you can choose between 
- [liboidc-agent4](api-c.md): Library for the C programming language,
- [liboidcagent-go](api-go.md): Library for the Go programming language,
- [liboidcagent-py](api-py.md): Library for the Python programming language,
- [IPC-API](api-ipc.md): Communicate directly with `oidc-agent`.

When you have integrated your application with `oidc-agent` you can contact us
at [oidc-agent-contact@lists.kit.edu](mailto:oidc-agent-contact@lists.kit.edu) and we will add your application to the [list of agent clients](agent-clients.md).
