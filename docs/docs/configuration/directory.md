## oidc-agent Directory

An oidc-agent directory will be created when using oidc-gen for the first time.
Depending on the existence of `~/.config` it will be located at one of these
locations:

- `~/.config/oidc-agent`
- `~/.oidc-agent`

Alternatively, the location can also be set through an environment variable
called `OIDC_CONFIG_DIR`. However, we note that this environment variable has
to be present whenever you use one of the `oidc-` binaries. It is therefore
recommend to set it in the `.bash_profile` or similar.

All account configuration files generated by `oidc-gen` are saved in this
oidc-agent directory. Additionally, there are some config files located in this directory.
