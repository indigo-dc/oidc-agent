### `--loaded`

This option is used without a shortname, because it will not load an account configuration. Using this option `oidc-add`
will print out a list of all the account configurations currently loaded in the agent.

### `--always-allow-idtoken`

`oidc-token` can also be used to request an id token from the agent. On default such requests have to be approved by the
user, since this is only meant as a development tool and other applications should not request id tokens from the agent
as id tokens are not meant for authorization. If the
`--always-allow-idtoken` option is specified to `oidc-add` when an account configuration is loaded, id token requests
for that account do not need confirmation by the user.

### `--confirm`

On default every application running as the same user as the agent can obtain an access token for every account
configuration from the agent. The `--confirm`
option can be used to change this behavior. If that option is used, the user has to confirm each usage of an account
configuration, allowing fine grained control from the user. When using this option with `oidc-add` only that specific
account needs confirmation.

### `--force`

On default an account configuration is only loaded if it is not already loaded. The `-f` or `--force` option can be used
to force a load. This can be used e.g. if the account configuration was changed, or to update the lifetime of the loaded
account.

### `--list`

This option is used without a shortname, because it will not load an account configuration. Using this option `oidc-add`
will print out a list of all configured account configurations. Configured means that they are saved on the system and
can be loaded with `oidc-add`; it does not mean that they are currently loaded. To show a list of currently loaded
accounts, use
`--loaded`.

### `--print`

Instead of loading the account configuration with the specified shortname, it will decrypt and print this configuration.

### `--pw-cmd`

The argument passed has to be a command that prints the encryption password for that account configuration to `stdout`
when executed. E.g. such a command could be `echo "superSecretPassword"`. (Note that this command is not recommended,
because the password is logged to your bash history.)

The command is used by `oidc-add` to retrieve the encryption password, so the user will not be prompted for it.
Additionally, it will also be used by
`oidc-agent` to get the encryption password when it needs to update the account configuration (
see [`--pw-store`](#pw-store) for information on why `oidc-agent` might need the encryption password).

See [Encryption Passwords](../security/encryption-passwords.md) for security related information about the
different `--pw-*` options.

### `--pw-env`

By default `oidc-add` will prompt the user for an encryption password when it needs to decrypt an account configuration.
The option `--pw-env` can be used to provide the encryption password via an environment variable. The name of the
environment variable can be passed to
`--pw-env`. If this option is used without an argument the encryption password is read from the environment
variable `OIDC_ENCRYPTION_PW`.

### `--pw-file`

The argument passed has to be the path to a file that contains the encryption password.

The password-file is used by `oidc-add` to retrieve the encryption password, so the user will not be prompted for it.
Additionally, it will also be used by
`oidc-agent` to get the encryption password when it needs to update the account configuration (
see [`--pw-store`](#pw-store) for information on why `oidc-agent` might need the encryption password).

See [Encryption Passwords](../security/encryption-passwords.md) for security related information about the
different `--pw-*` options.

### `--pw-gpg`

The `--pw-gpg`, `--pw-pgp`, `--gpg`, or `--pgp` option can be used to indicate that PGP encryption utilizing
the `gpg-agent` should be used. However, with `oidc-add` this option is usually not needed, because we can detect pgp
encryption from the account configuration file.

### `--pw-keyring`

When this option is provided, the encryption password will be stored by
`oidc-agent` in the system's default keyring. See [`--pw-store`](#pw-store) for information on why `oidc-agent` might
need the encryption password.

See [Encryption Passwords](../security/encryption-passwords.md) for security related information about the
different `--pw-*` options.

### `--pw-prompt`

This option can be used to change how `oidc-add` prompts the user for the encryption password. Possible values are `cli`
and `gui`. The default is `cli`.
`gui` requires oidc-agent-prompt to be installed.

### `--pw-store`

When this option is provided, the encryption password will be kept in memory by
`oidc-agent` (in an encrypted way). Usually none of the `--pw-*` options is needed, because `oidc-agent` does not have
to read or update the account configuration file after loading. However, some OpenID Providers might use rotating
refresh tokens. This means that for those providers `oidc-agent` has to update the client configuration file whenever a
new access token is retrieved from the OpenID Provider. If non of the
`--pw-*` options is provided, this means that the user will always be prompted to enter the encryption password. Because
this can get annoying, it is recommended to use any of the `--pw-*` options in such a case. For providers that are
effected by this we included notes in the [Help for different providers](../provider/provider.md).

See [Encryption Passwords](../security/encryption-passwords.md) for security related information about the
different `--pw-*` options.

### `--remove`

The `--remove` option is used to unload an account configuration. After unloading an account, it is not longer available
for other applications. Therefore, it has to be loaded again before an access token can be obtained
(either using oidc-add or through the autoload feature).

### `--remote`

This option is used to communicate with a remote `oidc-agent-server` instead of a local `oidc-agent`. It can only be
used for loading and unloading configurations. For more information refer to
[`oidc-agent-server`](oidc-agent-server/oidc-agent-server.md)

### `--remove-all`

With the `--remove-all` option all loaded account configuration can be removed from the agent with just one call. This
might be preferred over restarting the agent, because that way the agent will still be available everywhere.

### `--lifetime`

The `--lifetime` option can be used to set a lifetime for the loaded account configuration. This way the account
configuration will only be loaded for a limited time after which it is automatically removed from the agent. If a
default lifetime was specified when the agent was started, the
`oidc-add` option has priority and can overwrite the default lifetime for this account.

Using `--lifetime=0` means that the account configuration is not automatically removed. Because that's the default
behavior this option is only needed, if another default lifetime was specified with oidc-agent.

### `--lock`

The agent can be locked using the `--lock` option. While being locked the agent refuses all requests. This means that no
account configuration can be loaded / unloaded and no token can be obtained from the agent. Sensitive information will
be encrypted when the agent is locked (see also
[Memory Encryption](../security/memory.md)).

### `--unlock`

To unlock a locked agent the `--unlock` option is used. After unlocking the agent again accepts requests.
