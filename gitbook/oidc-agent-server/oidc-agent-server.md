# oidc-agent-server

`oidc-agent-server` was a special version of oidc-agent that could run as a central oidc-agent on a server. It was only
a temporary component and support for `oidc-agent-server` was removed with version 4.1.0.

A better alternative is the `mytoken` service. For more details about mytoken please refer to
the [mytoken documentation](https://mytoken-docs.data.kit.edu).
