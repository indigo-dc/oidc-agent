### `--accounts`

Using this option `oidc-gen` will print out a list of all configured account configurations. Configured means that they
are saved on the system and can be loaded with `oidc-add`; it does not mean that they are currently loaded. This option
is the same as `oidc-add --list`. To show a list of the accounts that are currently loaded use `oidc-add --loaded`.

### `--codeExchange`

When using the authorization code flow the user has to authenticate against the OpenID Provider in a web browser and is
then redirected back to the application. To be able to catch that redirect `oidc-agent` usually starts a small
webserver. If something goes wrong during the redirect (because the web server crashed or no web server was
used (`--no-webserver`)) the user can still finish the account configuration generation process. In such a case the suer
must copy the url he is redirected to from its browser and pass it to `oidc-gen --codeExchange`. Then oidc-gen should be
able to obtain and save the final account configuration.

Note that while this option also works for `edu.kit.data.oid-cagent:/`
redirect uris, it might not be possible to obtain the uri the user is redirected to from the browser.

### `--confirm-default`

When specifying this option all confirmation/consent prompts are automatically answered with the default value. This
option is useful when you want to use `oidc-gen`
non-interactive.

Examples for confirmation prompts are:

- When creating a new account configuration using dynamic client registration and the process is not finished but the
  client already registered and the process is started again it is possible to reuse the already registered client. In
  that case `oidc-gen` asks to use the temporary stored data.
  (Default: yes)
- When deleting an account configuration, `oidc-gen` asks if you are sure.
  (Default: no)
- When deleting an account configuration that used dynamic client registration,
  `oidc-gen` asks to delete the client at the provider. (Default: yes)
- When deleting an account configuration, the associated refresh token will be automatically deleted. In case this is
  not possible, `oidc-gen` asks if it should continue or not. (Default: no)

### `--confirm-no`

When specifying this option all confirmation/consent prompts are automatically declined. This option is useful when you
want to use `oidc-gen`
non-interactive.

For examples for confirmation prompts, see [`--confirm-default`](#confirm-default).

### `--confirm-yes`

When specifying this option all confirmation/consent prompts are automatically answered with `yes`. This option is
useful when you want to use `oidc-gen`
non-interactive.

For examples for confirmation prompts, see [`--confirm-default`](#confirm-default).

### `--cp`

This option allows the user to change the CA bundle file that is used to verify SSL/TLS certificates. A user must use
this option when `oidc-gen` cannot automatically find a proper CA bundle file (e.g. non default location). A user can
also use this option to provide a more restricted bundle file that only contains the certificates needed for a specific
provider.

### `--delete`

This option will delete the account configuration for the specified shortname. It will also revoke the used refresh
token and optionally delete the OIDC client (not implemented yet).

### `--file`

Can be used if the client was registered manually. Most OpenID Provider allow downloading the client configuration as a
json file (or copy the `JSON` config). Such a file can be used to reduce the amount of information passed to
`oidc-gen`. The argument should be the absolute path to a file containing the `JSON` formatted client
configuration. `oidc-gen` then reads the client configuration from this file, so that the user does not have to enter
all information manually.

Because this option is only used when a client was registered manually, it implicitly sets the `--manual` option.

### `--flow`

Depending on the OpenID Provider a user can use multiple OpenID/OAuth2 flows to obtain a refresh token. `oidc-agent`
uses the Refresh Flow to obtain additional access token. Therefore a refresh token is required which can be obtained in
multiple ways. The `--flow` flag can be used to enforce usage of a specific flow or to prioritise a flow over another.
`oidc-agent` will try all flows in the following order until one succeeds:

1. Refresh Flow
2. Password Flow
3. Authorization Code Flow
4. Device Flow

Possible values for the `--flow` option are: 'refresh', 'password', 'code', and 'device'. The flag can also be used if
multiple flows should be tried, but in a different order than the default one. To do so provide the option multiple
times with one value per option in the desired order.

In the following we will describe the different flows:

#### Out Of Band

If a user obtained a refresh token out of band he can directly provide it to
`oidc-gen` using the `--rt` option. The
`--flow=refresh` option is then implicitly set.

**Note:** Refresh tokens are bound to a specific client id. The provided refresh token must be issued for the provided
client id.

Obtaining a valid refresh token for the specific client id is out of scope of this documentation. We recommend one of
the following flows.

#### Password Flow

Most OIDPs do not support this flow. One provider that supports the password flow is INDIGO IAM, for additional
information on support of the password flow for a specific provider see the documentation for
different [providers](../provider/provider.md). The password flow can be performed using only the command line. The
credentials for the OpenID Provider have to be provided to `oidc-gen`. The credentials are only used to obtain the
refresh token and are not stored. However, there are alternatives flows that do not reveal the user's credentials
to `oidc-agent`.

#### Authorization Code Flow

The authorization code flow is the most widely used and is therefore supported by any OpenID Provider and does not
reveal user credentials to `oidc-agent`. However, it requires a browser on the system running `oidc-agent`
and `oidc-gen`. If you don't have a browser on that system or don't want to use it you can use the Device Flow, if
supported by the provider. If the authorization code flow is the only flow supported by your provider and have to obtain
a working account configuration on a machine that does not have a browser (e.g. a server), you can create the account
configuration on another machine and copy / move the account configuration file to the server.

To use the Authorization Code Flow at least one redirect uri has to be provided (
see [Redirect Uri](../provider/client-configuration-values.md#redirect-uri)). The redirect uri must be of the
scheme `http://localhost:<port>`. It is recommend to use a port which is very unlikely to be used by any other
application (during the account generation process). Additionally multiple redirect uris can be provided.

When starting the account generation process `oidc-agent` will try to open a webserver on the specified ports. If one
port fails the next one is tried. After a successful startup `oidc-gen` will receive an authorization URI. When calling
this URI the user has to authenticate against the OpenID Provider; afterwards the user is redirected to the previously
provided redirect uri where the agent's webserver is waiting for the response. The agent receives an authorization code
that is exchanged for the required token. `oidc-gen` is polling `oidc-agent` to get the generated account configuration
and finally save it.

#### Device Flow

The device flow is a flow specifically for devices with limited input possibilities or without a web browser.
Unfortunately, it is currently not supported by many OpenID Providers.

To use the device flow the user has to call `oidc-gen` with the `--flow=device`
option. `oidc-gen` will print a verification url and an user code. If `qrencode`
is installed on the system, the verification url is also printed as a QR-Code. The user must open the given url using a
second device and enter the given user code. Through polling the agent will get a refresh token and `oidc-gen` the
generated account configuration.

If the OpenID Provider does not provide the device authorization endpoint in their openid-configuration it has to
provided manually using the `--dae`
option. For help on a specific provider check the [provider documentation](../provider/provider.md)

### `--manual`

This option has to be used if a user wants to use a manually registered client.
`oidc-gen` will then not use dynamic client registration. Additional metadata about the already registered client must
be passed to `oidc-gen`
when beeing prompted or using command line arguments (where they are available).

### `--no-scheme`

This option can be used when the authorization code flow is performed. The `--no-scheme` option tells
`oidc-agent` that a custom uri scheme should not be used for redirection. Normally a custom uri scheme can be used to
redirect direct to (another) oidc-gen instance when performing the authorization code flow instead of using a web
server. However, the redirect to oidc-gen requires a graphical desktop environment. If this is not present, redirection
with custom uri schemes can be disabled with this option.

This option can be used with `oidc-gen` or `oidc-agent`. When using it with `oidc-gen` it will only disable custom uri
schemes for that specific call; when using it with `oidc-agent` it will disable custom uri schemes for all calls to
that `oidc-agent` instance.

### `--no-url-call`

When using the authorization code flow the user must authenticate against the OpenID Provider using a webbrowser. To do
this `oidc-gen` prints an authorization url the user has to open. On default this url is automatically opened in the
default webbrowser (using `xdg-open`). One can disable this behavior with the `--no-url-call` option. When this option
is passed
`oidc-gen` will not automatically open the authorization url. The user then has to manually copy it to his webbrowser.

### `--no-webserver`

This option can be used when the authorization code flow is performed. On default a small webserver is started
by `oidc-agent` to be able to catch the redirect and complete the authorization code flow. The `--no-webserver` option
tells
`oidc-agent` that no webserver should be started. The authorization code flow can still be completed. Either by using a
redirect uri that follows the custom redirect uri scheme `edu.kit.data.oidc-agent:/<path>` - this will directly redirect
to oidc-gen, or by copying the url the browser would normally redirect to and pass it to `oidc-gen --codeExchange`.

This option can be used with `oidc-gen` or `oidc-agent`. When using it with `oidc-gen` it will only disable the
webserver for that specific call; when using it with `oidc-agent` it will disable the webserver for all calls to
that `oidc-agent` instance.

### `--oauth2`

The `--oauth` or `--oauth2` option can be used with providers that support OAuth2 but not OpenID Connect. This is mainly
used so that the `openid` scope is not required.

### `--only-at`

The `--only-at` option of `oidc-gen` can be used to obtain an access token without creating an account configuration.
You still have to provide a valid client configuration. There are several ways of doing so. The option can be combined
with the different ways of using `oidc-gen`, but it will not work with dynamic client registration. The following is a
short overview:

- `oidc-gen --only-at -m` Manually provide the needed information (with prompting)
- `oidc-gen --only-at -f <filepath>` Manually provide the needed information by passing the path to a json file with the
  client information.
- `oidc-gen --only-at` Use a public client defined in the `pubclients.conf` file.

Notes:

- It's possible to overwrite some or all of the passed values with command line options.
- You always have to provide the issuer url and the scopes to be used (but can do so in the passed file).
- When using a public client that does not have a client secret you must pass the `--pub` option.

Here are three examples how a user can obtain the access token and store it in an environment variable without providing
any other information:

```
export AT=`oidc-gen --only-at --iss=<issuer_url> --scope-max --prompt=none` # requires that a public client for <issuer_url> is listed in pubclients.conf
export AT=`oidc-gen --only-at --iss=<issuer_url> --client-id=<client_id> --client-secret=<client_secret> --redirect-url="http://localhost:8080" --scope=profile --prompt=none`
export AT=`oidc-gen --only-at -f<filepath> --prompt=none`
```

In the last call `<filepath>` points to file with the following content:

```
{
  "issuer_url": "https://example.com",
  "client_id": "clientid",
  "client_secret": "clientsecret",
  "scope": "openid profile email",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://localhost:34170",
    "http://localhost:4242"
  ]
}
```

Note that the `--only-at` option can be used with any flow.

### `--print`

Using this option `oidc-gen` will read the specified file and print out the decrypted content. You can either pass an
account shortname to print out the decrypted account configuration or an absolute filepath (needed if you want to
decrypt client configuration files or other files encrypted by `oidc-gen`).

### `--prompt`

This option can be used to change how `oidc-gen` prompts the user for information. There are different options
available. Allowed values are `cli`, `gui`, and `none`. The default is `cli`. This is the normal mode as it also was
before version 4.0.0. The suer is prompted for information on the command line. When selecting `gui`, `oidc-gen` will
use graphical pop-up prompts. This requires `oidc-agent-prompt` to be installed. When `none` is selected, `oidc-gen`
will not prompt for any information, which requires that the needed information is passed through command line options.

Changing the prompt mode to `gui` will also change the password prompt mode to
`gui` (see [`--pw-prompt`](#pw-prompt)). Changing it to `none`, will not change the password prompt mode, because this
cannot set to `none`.

### `--pub`

When this option is provided, `oidc-gen` will use a public client. If
`--manual` is not provided, normally a client would be registered dynamically. However, with the `--pub` option, a
preregistered public client is used. Preregistered public clients are listed in
`/etc/oidc-agent/pubclients.config`. If the `--manual` option is specified this allows usage of a public client that was
registered manually (the
`client_secret` parameter will be optional).

This option is also required to update an account configuration that uses a public client.

### `--pw-cmd`

By default `oidc-gen` will prompt the user for an encryption password when it needs to encrypt or decrypt an account
configuration. The option `--pw-cmd` can be used to provide a command that will print the needed encryption password
to `stdout`. Then `oidc-gen` can obtain the password from that command instead of prompting the user.

### `--pw-env`

By default `oidc-gen` will prompt the user for an encryption password when it needs to encrypt or decrypt an account
configuration. The option `--pw-env` can be used to provide the encryption password via an environment variable. The
name of the environment variable can be passed to
`--pw-env`. If this option is used without an argument the encryption password is read from the environment
variable `OIDC_ENCRYPTION_PW`.

### `--pw-file`

By default `oidc-gen` will prompt the user for an encryption password when it needs to encrypt or decrypt an account
configuration. The option `--pw-file` can be used to provide the path to a file that contains the needed encryption
password. Then `oidc-gen` can obtain the password from that file.

### `--pw-gpg`

The `--pw-gpg`, `--pw-pgp`, `--gpg`, or `--pgp` option can be used to indicate that PGP encryption utilizing `gpg-agent`
should be used. The option takes a gpg key id and this key will be used for encryption. By using this approach one does
not have to enter a password or pass it with one of the other `--pw-*` options whenever the file must be
decrypted/encrypted. With PGP encryption, oidc-agent can utilize the `gpg-agent` for encryption. As long as the key is
loaded in the `gpg-agent`, no password must be entered.

This approach is very useful with providers where the refresh tokens changes regularly, but it is also very practical
for all other providers.

### `--pw-prompt`

This option can be used to change how `oidc-gen` prompts the user for the encryption password. Possible values are `cli`
and `gui`. The default is `cli`.
`gui` requires oidc-agent-prompt to be installed.

### `--reauthenticate`

This option can be used to update an existing account configuration file with a new refresh token. Useful if - for some
reason - the refresh token is not valid anymore. One could also use `--manual` to update an existing account
configuration; however if no other information has to be changed the
`--reauthenticate` option is easier.

### `--rename`

This option can be used to rename an existing account configuration file. It is not enough to simply rename the file in
the file system. One could also use `--manual` to update an existing account configuration; however if no other
information has to be changed the
`--rename` option is easier.

### `--update`

This option can be used to update the encryption and / or file format for a file generated by oidc-gen. It will decrypt
and re-encrypt the file content, therefore updating encryption and file format to the newest version. This option can
also be used to encrypt plain text files, e.g. a client configuration that was downloaded from the OpenID Provider - do
not use it as a general file encryption tool. The passed parameter can be an absolute path or the name of a file placed
in oidc-dir (e.g. an account configuration short name).

### `--at`

The `--at` option is used during dynamic client registration. If the registration endpoint is protected and can only
accessed with proper authentication, the user has to pass the token used for authentication to the
`--at` option.

### `--aud`

The `--aud` option can be used to set the audience of obtained access tokens. Protected resources should not accept a
token if they are not listed as audience. Therefore, this is a mechanism to restrict the usage of an access token to
certain resources.

The audience of individual access tokens can also be set with `oidc-token --aud`.

See [`oidc-token --aud`](../oidc-token/options.md#aud) for more information.

### `--client-id`

The `--client-id` option can be used to set the client id that should be used.

### `--client-secret`

The `--client-secrete` option can be used to set the client secret that should be used.

### `--cnid`

The `--cnid` option can be used to set an additional client name identifier. This might be useful in the case a user has
multiple machines that run `oidc-agent` and he configures new account configurations for each machine. However, they
should have the same shortname on all machines. While this is possible, the clientname for all of these clients will be
of the form `oidc-agent:<shortname>`. With the same shortname the clients cannot be distinguished easily in a web
interface provided by the OpenID Provider. Most provider allow to access a list with authorized applications. If a user
has an account configuration for `example` on two different machines, he will see the `oidc-agent:example` entry twice
and cannot identify which entry belongs to which machine. However, this is possible using the `--cnid` option. This
option allows the user to specify an additional component of the client name
`oidc-agent:<shortname>-<cnid>`. A user could use for example the hostname of the machine. Then there are two different
applications listed in the provider's web interface and the clients can be matched to the correct machine where that
client is indeed used.

### `--configuration-endpoint`

The `--config-endpoint` or `--configuration-endpoint` or `--discovery-endpoint` option can be used to manually set the
endpoint where the provider publishes its metadata. Usually, this is a well-known location and does not need to be set.
For providers that do not have a configuration endpoint this option is useful. In particular a uri of the
form `file:///path/to/file` can be used to point to a local file where the required information is stored in the json
format and according to the discovery specification. If the configuration endpoint is provided the issuer url is not
required anymore - but it still can be provided.

### `--dae`

The `--dae` option explicitly sets the `device authorization endpoint uri`. When performing the device flow `oidc-agent`
has to send information to this endpoint. Usually oidc-agent can obtain this uri from the provider's configuration
endpoint. However, if the provider does not publish its device authorization endpoint uri at its configuration endpoint,
the user has to tell `oidc-agent` where the device authorization endpoint can be found. Therefore, the uri has to be
passed to the `--dae` option. Check the documentation about [providers](../provider/provider.md) for information if you
need this option with your provider.

### `--issuer`

The `--issuer` option can be used to set the issuer url that should be used.

### `--op-password`

The `--op-password` option can be used to set the user's password at the OpenID provider. This option only applies when
the password flow is used. Note that it is not recommended to use the password flow in general; even more it is not
recommended to set the password from the command line. Please use prompting for this.

### `--op-username`

The `--op-username` option can be used to set the user's username at the OpenID provider. This option only applies when
the password flow is used.

### `--port`

This option can be used to set redirect uris. Only the port must be provided and it will result in a redirect uri of the
form `http://localhost:<port>`. This option is a short option for `--redirect-uri` (only the port has to be provided).
Passing `--port=1234` is equivalent to passing
`--redirect-uri=http://localhost:1234`.

For more information see [-`-redirect-uri`](#redirect-uri).

### `--redirect-uri`

This option can be used to set the redirect uri to be used. This applies to two cases:

- When the client was manually registered, the option can be used to pass the registered redirect uris.
- When the client will be registered dynamically, the option can be used to pass the redirect uris that should be
  registered.

On default `oidc-agent` will register multiple redirect uris when using dynamic client registration. One redirect uri
that uses the custom uri scheme `edu.kit.data.oidc-agent:/<path>` and three redirect uris to `localhost` using different
port numbers. Two of these port numbers are `4242` and `8080`; the third port number will be chosen randomly. When
starting the webserver `oidc-agent` will try all of these ports, stopping when the first succeeds. We cannot make any
guarantees on the order in which these ports are tried.

This might be a problem in environments with restrictions to ports, e.g. containers. In such environments it's useful to
use the `--redirect-uri` or `--port` option to manually set the port(s) that should be used (`oidc-agent` will register
redirect uris with that port numbers). By using these options one can pass only ports that will be available in the
restricted environment. Note that
`oidc-agent` still makes no guarantees about the order in which these ports will be tried.

### `--rt`

This option can be used to pass a refresh token that should be used. Because this will use the refresh flow this option
implicitly sets `--flow=refresh`.

**Note:** Refresh tokens are bound to a specific client id. The provided refresh token must be issued for the provided
client id.

### `--rt-env`

Like `--rt` but reads the refresh token from an environment variable. The name of the environment variable can be passed
to
`--rt-env`. If this option is used without an argument the refresh token is read from the environment
variable `OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN`.

### `--scope`

The `--scope` option can be used to set the scopes that should be used with this account configuration. Multiple scopes
can be provided as a space separated list or by using the option multiple times. Pass `max` to use all available scopes
for this provider.

### `--scope-all` and `--scope-max`

The `--scope-all` and `--scope-max` options can be used to set the scopes that should be used with this account
configuration to the maximum. I.e. this means that all scopes supported by the provider will be used. When using a
public client all scopes available for that client will be used.
