## oidc-agent 5.0.0 PRE

oidc-agent 5 is a major update that brings the power of a true configuration file and focuses on improving the user
experience and usability.

### Changes

- Reworked the `issuer.config` file:
    - The `issuer.config` file in `/etc/oidc-agent` is updated on package upgrade
    - The `issuer.config` in user's oidc-agent dir is automatically updated when needed
    - The new format allows to set and tweak options / behavior on a per-issuer basis, e.g. if the encryption password
      should be stored.
- Dropped oidc-agent `--pw-lifetime` option. This did not work as expected. The intended usage can be achieved with
  the `issuer.config` file.
- Dropped support for storing encryption password in system's keyring (`--pw-keyring`)
    - This still can be done through `--pw-cmd`
- Changed the oidc-agent-service socket dir from `/tmp/oidc-agent-service/<uid>` to `/tmp/oidc-agent-service-<uid>`.
  This allows (better) multiple users to run oidc-agent-service.
    - This is a breaking change for all existing terminals that already have a `$OIDC_SOCK` set to a service socket. The
      easiest way to make sure that also existing sessions with the old path have access to a newly started agent,
      create a link from the old location to the new one, i.e.
  ```bash
  rm -rf /tmp/oidc-agent-service/${UID}/
  ln -s /tmp/oidc-agent-service-${UID} /tmp/oidc-agent-service/${UID}
  ```

### Features

- Added support for RFC8707 to request ATs with specific audiences
    - Changed default audience request method to RFC8707
    - Old audience request behavior can be enabled for issuers through the `issuer.config` file.
    - For known IAM instances legacy aud mode is enabled by default
- Added support for `oidc-agent <command> [command_args]`, similar to ssh-agent; e.g. `oidc-agent bash` starts the agent
  and makes it available in a new bash.

### Security Fixes:

- Fixed permissions of agent socket.

### API

- Added possibility to obtain (extended) account information from the agent. This includes all available accounts,
  associated to their OP issuer, an indicator if the account is loaded or not, and an indicator if there is a public
  client available for an issuer.
- Dropped deprecated functions from liboidc-agent
- Renamed numbered functions in liboidc-agent

### Enhancements

- A lot of the configuration options in the configuration file greatly improve the user experience, the following are
  just a few examples of what is possible:
    - Automatically store the encryption password for certain issuers
    - Automatically encrypt new account configuration with gpg
    - Automatically use a pre-registered client
    - Automatically prefer configurations via a mytoken server if issuer is available there

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug that potentially could cause a segmentation fault
- Fixed a bug related to http retrying that potentially could cause a segmentation fault
- Fixed a problem in oidc-agent-service where only one user could run oidc-agent-service

### Dependencies

## oidc-agent 4.3.0

oidc-agent 4.3.0 is a bigger release with some major changes and smaller fixes and enhancements.

### Windows

This is the first release with official support for Windows. We provide an installer that installs all needed tools and
libraries. While the windows version of oidc-agent works fine and can be used as a daily driver it is not as major as
the unix versions.

### oidc-prompt

The `oidc-prompt` tool was rewritten. The new tool now provides are more modern and consistent interface across
platforms. It also enables more advanced prompts which will be utilized in future versions.

### Seccomp

- Support for seccomp was **dropped** with this version.

### Other Features

- OAuth2 support:
    - `oidc-agent` does not only check `/.well-known/openid-configuration` but
      also `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` for server's metadata
    - For oauth2 account configurations `openid` is not a required scope
- Custom discovery/configuration endpoint
    - The `--config-endpoint` option of `oidc-gen` can be used to pass the uri of the server's configuration endpoint
    - This can be used for providers that do not advertise their metadata at one of the well-known location or not at
      all
    - A local file can be used by using an uri of the form `file:///path/to/file`
    - If a configuration endpoint is given the issuer url is no longer mandatory (since it can be read from the
      configuration endpoint)

### Enhancements

- Improved some build options, so oidc-agent should build with musl libc.
- Improved handling of the `--only-at` option.
- The `oidc-add` `-l` and `-a` option and the `oidc-gen` `-l` option now print the header line only if connected to a
  tty.
- `oidc-add` now checks if an account is already loaded before loading it (and prompting the user for a password).
  The `-f` option can be used to force a load even if the account is already loaded.
- `oidc-agent-service` now respects environment variables over values set in an `oidc-agent-service.options` file.
- `oidc-keychain` was rewritten to utilize `oidc-agent-service`
- Removed a superfluous error log message on the first account config generated.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where the `--only-at` option of `oidc-gen` was not working correctly and no AT was obtained if the OP did
  not send an RT, but only the AT
- Fixed a bug where an account configuration became unusable when the auto-reauthentication flow was triggered with the
  device flow, but not completed.
- Fixed a bug where `oidc-add -l` would print `Error: success` when the oidc-agent directory does not exist yet.

### OpenID Provider

- Issuer urls of some providers in the `issuer.config` were not correct (difference in a trailing slash) and have been
  fixed. This change only applies to the issuer url stored in `/etc/oidc-agent/issuer.config`. Issuer urls in
  the `issuer.config` file in the oidc-agent directory have to be updated by the user (this is optional, but
  recommended).
- Added the production, instance of the EGI-Checking keycloak based OP as issuers
- Added public client for production instance of the EGI-Checking keycloak based OP
- Replaced the demo and development instances of the EGI-Checking OP with the keycloak based one
- Replaced public clients for demo and development instances of the EGI-Checking with the keycloak based OP

### Dependencies

- `oidc-prompt` (oidc-agent-desktop packages) no longer depends on `yad` (`pashua` on MacOS), instead `gtk3`
  and `gtk-webkit2` are needed on linux)

## oidc-agent 4.2.6

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where in the base64 decoding the wrong number was passed to the library function which on some platforms
  could lead to errors

## oidc-agent 4.2.5

### Other

- Fix formatting in gitbook

## oidc-agent 4.2.4

### Bugfixes:

- Fixed potential uncontrolled format string

## oidc-agent 4.2.3

## oidc-agent 4.2.2

### Bugfixes:

- Fixed cleanup of tmp directory for `oidc-agent-service`
- Fixed typo that could cause a wrongly formatted error message

### Other

- Fixed a typo
- Fixed cast warning on libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.71

## oidc-agent 4.2.1

### Enhancements

- Encoding spaces printed authorization url, so it can be easily opened.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed problems on MacOS where automatic url opening did not work.

## oidc-agent 4.2.0

### Features

- Add option to encrypt account config file through gpg agent with an existing gpg key instead of using an encryption
  password
    - This feature comes very handy for accounts where the refresh tokens changes often (but can be used with any
      account configuration file)
    - To use gpg encryption when creating a new account include the `--gpg=<key_id>` option to your `oidc-gen` call
    - To update an existing account configuration to use gpg encryption run `oidc-gen -u <shortname> --gpg=<key_id>`
- Add Auto-re-authentication feature: When `oidc-agent` discovers that a refresh token expired it automatically triggers
  a re-authentication flow.

### API

- IPC-API:
    - The error response for an Access Token Request now might contain an `info` field. If present this field contains a
      formatted help message that gives instructions to the user how the problem can most likely be solved. Applications
      should display this message to the user if it is present.
- The `C` library `liboidcagent4` now has functions that return an `agent_response` that on error include the error and
  the help message. For details see https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/api/api-c#error-handling
- The `go` and `python` libraries have been adapted to support the help message. For details refer to:
    - https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/api/api-go
    - https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/api/api-py#error-handling

### Enhancements

- Now using `libqrencode` to print a QR code when using the device flow; instead of using `qrencode` only if already
  installed.
- Token revocation can now handle cases where there must be provided a `client_id` in the request.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where an error message was printed even tough no error occurred when `oidc-gen` tried to read a tmp file
  from `oidc-agent` and `oidc-gen` could not connect to agent.
- Fixed bug on MacOS where command line flags that are aliases would not accept argument
- Excluded `.log` files from account list
- Fixed bugs where some `--pw-*` options (mainly `--pw-file` and `--pw-env`) where not used by `oidc-agent`
- Fixed memory leaks in `oidc-agent`.
- Fixed handling of multiple OIDC flows by `oidc-agent`.
- Fixed bash completion on bullseye printing deprecation message
- Fixed potential TOCTOU filesystem race condition

- Improved the user prompt message for autoload when the application does not send an application_hint
- Fix a bug related to the confirm feature: after a request is declined it was impossible to get an access token for
  this configuration without reloading the configuration.

### Enhancements

- Improved error handling when a wrong refresh token is used

## oidc-agent 2.3.0

### Features

- Autoload: If an application requests an access token for an account configuration that is not yet loaded the user can
  be prompted to load it and then the application can receive the requested access token. No need to run `oidc-add`
  preventively. See also
  the [Tips section in the documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/tips.html#autoloading-and-autounloading-account-configurations)
  .
- Confirmation: When loading an account configuration with `oidc-add` the new `-c`/`--confirm` option can be used.
  Similar to `ssh-add` this option requires confirmation by the user whenever the account configuration should be used,
  i.e. whenever an application requests an access token for that account configuration the user will be prompted if he
  wants to allow or deny this usage. The option can also be turned on for all configuration loaded into the agent when
  specifying this option on agent startup.
- Changing refresh token: A provider might decide that it issues a new refresh token whenever an access token is issued.
  In that case `oidc-agent` has to update the account configuration file. To do this the agent requires the encryption
  password. The agent supports user prompting, keeping it encrypted in memory, reading it from a user provided command,
  and saving it in the system's keyring.
- Custom uri schemes: By using a redirect uri of the form `edu.kit.data.oidc-agent:/<path>` the agent can skip the
  normally started httpserver and redirect directly to `oidc-gen` to complete the account configuration generation
  process.
- Manual redirect: The auth code flow can now be done completly without the httpserver started by `oidc-agent`. Either
  through usage of a custom uri scheme redirect url or by manually copying the url the user is redirect to from the
  browser and passing it to `oidc-gen --codeExchange='<url>'`.
- XSession integration: `oidc-agent` is now integrated with Xsession to automatically be available in all terminals
  throughout an Xsession.

### Changes

- Changed the underlying architecture by splitting `oidc-agent` internally into two components
- Changed the `oidc-agent` flag for console mode from `-c` to `-d`
- Changed the default port for redirect urls registered with dynamically registered clients from `2912` to `4242`

### Enhancements

- When the auth code flow fails at the redirect because of problems with the httpserver, the url can be passed manually
  to `oidc-gen --codeExchange='<url>'`
- When a refresh token expired the user has to reauthenticate to obtain a new valid refresh token. Instead of
  using `oidc-gen -m` to do this the user can also use the new `oidc-gen --reauthenticate` option (the user won't have
  to confirm that all other data should not be changed).
- The `oidc-gen -u` option that updates an encrypted file to the newest encryption and file format version can now also
  be used with unencrypted files
- When using `oidc-gen -d` the account config now does not have to be loaded. The refresh token can also be revoked if
  not loaded.
- Improved the [documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/)
- Communication between the agent and its httpserver is now encrypted
- Improved usability of `oidc-gen` with some smaller enhancements at various places
- Other smaller enhancements

### OpenID Provider

- Added a public client for HBP
- Added a public client for Elixir

## oidc-agent 2.2.0

### Features

- Support for PKCE
- Public clients: If dynamic client registration is not supported by a provider, public clients can be used (for some
  providers) so that a user does not have to register its own client manually.

## oidc-agent 2.0.1

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug related to merging json objects

### Enhancements

- Improved oidc-gen user interface:
    - oidc-gen now does not prompt for a refresh token on default. Instead the `--rt` option can be used.
    - oidc-gen now only prompts for credentials if the password flow is used (`--flow=password`)
- Improved internal flow handling of dynamic client registration

## oidc-agent 2.0.0

### Features

- **Combined Configuration File:**
  When using dynamic client registration the default behavior is now to generate only one configuration file containing
  both client configuration and account configuration.

  **Under very rare conditions this might break an old configuration file.**
  If this happens, use `oidc-gen -p <shortname>` to display the decrypted content. You can then use this information to
  generate a new account configuration (using `oidc-gen -m`).

- **Account Lifetime:**
  Added to possibility to set a lifetime for account configurations. After this time the account is automatically
  removed from the agent. It is possible to set a default lifetime for all account configurations when
  starting `oidc-agent` using the new `-t` option. It is also possible to specify a lifetime with `-t` when loading a
  configuration with `oidc-add`.

- **Better Support for Turning Colors Off:**
  It is now possible to turn colors off in different ways:
    - set the `NO_COLOR` environment variable: Color support is turned off if this variable is presented (regardless of
      its value).
    - set `TERM` to `dumb`: color support is turned off if the `TERM` variable is set to `dumb`.
    - set `OIDC_AGENT_NOCOLOR` to a non zero value.

  Colors can be turned on for oidc-agent regardless of the above mentioned variables by setting the `OIDC_AGENT_NOCOLOR`
  environemnt variable to `0`. Furthermore color is turned off if not connected to a tty (e.g. if output redirected to a
  file).

- **Memory Encryption:**
  Sensitive Information is obfuscated in memory to improve security.

- **Agent Lockable:**
  Added the possibility to lock the agent. When locked the agent refuses any operation until it is unlocked. While being
  locked additional encryption is applied to the sensitive information kept in memory.

- **Seccomp:**
  Restricted the set of syscalls that can be made by each component. If this feature causes problems on a specific
  system it can be turned off with the `--no-seccomp` option.

- **List Currently Loaded Account Configurations:**
  This feature was removed.

- **Automatically Open Authorization URL:**
  Added possibility to turn off the automatic opening of the authorization url (authorization code flow) using
  the `--no-url-call` option.

- **Unloading Accounts:**
  Unloading an account configuration does not require the password anymore. Also added an option to unload all loaded
  account configuration at once.

- **oidc-token:**
  Added the possibility to not only get an access token with `oidc-token` but also get the associated issuer and the
  expiration time of this token. To do so the new `-o`, `-i`, `-e`, `-a`, and `-c` options can be used. This also allows
  calling oidc-token with `eval` to directly set one or multiple environment variables.

### Changes to the CLI

- Added support for bash completion
- No longer using space delimited lists. To provide multiple values for an option the option can be provided multiple
  times.

### API

#### C-API

- Removed `char* getLoadedAccounts()`: It is not possible anymore to get the list of currently loaded configuration from
  the agent.
- A TokenResponse now includes the token, the issuer, and the expiration date.
- A TokenRequest should include an application hint. For detailed information refer to
  the [documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/api.html)

#### IPC-API

- Removed the `account_list` request. Applications that use this request to check if an account is loaded before
  requesting an access token for it, should simply request the access token. If the account is not loaded, an error is
  returned.
- Access token request should now include an `application_hint`.
- The Response to a token request now includes the expiration time of the token (as well as the token and the associated
  issuer url). For detailed information refer to the [documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/api.html)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where conflicting response types were registered.
- Fixed a bug where the automatic account configuration generation failed after dynamic client registration.
- Fixed a bug where only the first 4096 bytes of an ipc message were sent.
- Fixed a bug related to token revocation.
- Fixed a bug with empty IPC messages.
- Fixed numerous bugs added during development.
- Fixed some smaller bugs.
