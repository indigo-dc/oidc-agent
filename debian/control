Description: Commandline tool for obtaining OpenID Connect Access tokens on the commandline
 oidc-agent is a set of tools to manage OpenID Connect tokens and make them
 easily usable from the command line. These tools follow ssh-agent design,
 so OIDC tokens can be handled in a similar way as ssh keys.  The agent
 stores multiple configurations and their associated refresh tokens
 securely.
 This tool consists of five programs:
   - oidc-agent that handles communication with the OIDC provider
   - oidc-gen that generates config files
   - oidc-add that loads (and unloads) configuration into the agent
   - oidc-token that can be used to get access token on the command line
   - oidc-keychain that re-uses oidc-agent across logins

Description: oidc-agent desktop integration
 Desktop integration files for oidc-gen and oidc-agent and for creating the user
 dialog.
 .
 This package adds two ways for supporting the usage of oidc-agent in a
 graphical environment.
 The .desktop file to leverage browser integration to support the authorization
 code flow in oidc-gen.
 The Xsession file to consistently set the environment variables necessary to
 for client tools to connect to the oidc-agent daemon.
 .
 This package also provides a bash script as an interface to create different
 dialog windows. It uses yad to create windows.
